## Warnings

The NilspodLib uses various warnings to indicate potential issues with recorded files or processing steps.
While these are helpful and can prevent hour long head scratching, they can be distracting in particular, when large amount of data is processed.

To ignore warnings, you can use Python's `warnings` package:

```python
import warnings
from nilspodlib.exceptions import LegacyWarning, CorruptedPackageWarning

warnings.simplefilter('ignore', (LegacyWarning, CorruptedPackageWarning))
```

The example above will ignore all `LegacyWarning` and `CorruptedPackageWarning`.
For a list of all NilsPodlib specific warnings view the `NilsPodLib/exceptions.py` file.
