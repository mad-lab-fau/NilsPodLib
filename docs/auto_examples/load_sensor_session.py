print('This session has {} datasets'.format(len(session.datasets)))

# However, in many cases it is easier to use one of the Session constructors:
session = Session.from_folder_path(FILEPATH, filter_pattern='*.bin')

# Like Datasets contain convenience methods to act on all Datastreams, Sessions provide methods that work on all
# datasets

# The library differentiates between synchronised and not synchronised session.
# If your session is synchronised your should use a SyncedSession

# If you need to switch off this validation, you can disable it using:
SyncedSession.VALIDATE_ON_INIT = False

# For synced sessions you can get the datasets of the master and the slaves separately

print('The master of the session is', session.master.info.sensor_id)

# To make use of the sync information, all datasets need to be aligned. This can be done using the `cut_to_syncregion`
# method.

# After this all session are aligned and the dataset counter are identical
