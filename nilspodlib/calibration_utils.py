    """Save a calibration info object in the correct format and file name for NilsPods.

    The files will be saved in the format `folder/{sensor_id}_%Y-%m-%d_%H-%M.json` by default.
    If you want to recreate the default folder structure of `imucal`, pass
    `folder_structure="{sensor_id}/{cal_info.CAL_TYPE}"` to the function.

    The naming schema and format is of course just a suggestion, and any structure can be used as long as it can be
    converted back into a CalibrationInfo object.
    However, following the naming convention will allow to use other calibration utils to search for suitable
    calibration files.

    .. note:: If the folder does not exist it will be created.

    Parameters
    ----------
    calibration :
        The CalibrationInfo object ot be saved
    sensor_id :
        The for 4 letter/digit identifier of a sensor_type, as obtained from
        :py:meth:`nilspodlib.header.Header.sensor_id`
    cal_time :
        The date and time (min precision) when the calibration was performed. It is preferable to pass this
        value in UTC timezone, as this is in line with the time handling in the rest of the library.
    folder :
        Basepath of the folder, where the file will be stored.
    folder_structure :
        A valid formatted Python string using the `{}` syntax.
        `sensor_id`, calibration as the name `cal_info` and kwargs will be passed to the `str.format` as keyword
        arguments and can be used in the string.

    Returns
    -------
    output_file_name
        The name under which the calibration file was saved

    Parameters
    ----------

    filter_cal_type :
        Whether only files obtain with a certain calibration type should be found.
        This will look for the `CalType` inside the json file and could cause performance issues with many calibration
        files.
        If None, all found files will be returned.
        For possible values, see the `imucal` library.
    custom_validator :
        A custom function that will be called with the CalibrationInfo object of each potential match.
        This needs to load the json file of each match and could cause performance issues with many calibration files.
    ignore_file_not_found :
        If True this function will not raise an error, but rather return an empty list, if no
        calibration files were found for the specific sensor_type.

    Returns
    -------
        list_of_cals
            List of paths pointing to available calibration objects.

    before_after :
        Can either be 'before' or 'after', if the search should be limited to calibrations that were
        either before or after the specified date. If None the closest value ignoring if it was before or after the
        measurement.
    warn_thres :
        If the distance to the closest calibration is larger than this threshold, a warning is emitted

    Notes
    -----
    If there are multiple calibrations that have the same date/hour/minute distance form the measurement,
    the calibration before the measurement will be chosen. This can be overwritten using the `before_after` para.

    -------
    cal_file_path or None
